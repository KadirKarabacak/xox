# XOX Game with React
 
#### The project is a XOX game defined by those who are waiting for you.

#### I created the project entirely with CSS and React. For state checks, I created a dynamic structure by using useState and useEffect, which are the wonderful hooks that React offers us. The user interface and functionality are entirely my own and I tried to design them fully responsive.


### Gameplay and Algorithm ⏬

- Player "X" always starts the game.
- After each cell is clicked, the player changes, the cell becomes deactivated and the cell value is memorized.
- The same cell cannot be clicked more than once.
- The Replay button clears the cells for you and resets the player order.
- In case of each win, 1 point is added to the player's score.
- The first player to reach 5 points wins the game.
- After reaching 5 points, the scores are reset and the game starts from the beginning.
